SONAR Rock vs Mine Prediction with Python | End To End Python Machine Learning Project

This portfolio explores a dataset collected from sonar equipment to differentiate between rocks and other marine objects such as mines. The dataset comprises various acoustic features recorded from different angles, including the frequency and amplitude of sound waves reflected from objects underwater. Through exploratory analysis and machine learning using Logistic Regression, this portfolio aims to understand patterns in sonar data and build a model capable of predicting whether an object is a rock or a mine based on its acoustic characteristics. Using Python and the scikit-learn library, this portfolio showcases the data cleaning process, exploratory analysis, splitting the dataset into training and testing data, as well as training and evaluating the model to predict the class of marine objects with reliable accuracy. By combining domain understanding of sonar and expertise in Python programming, this portfolio offers valuable insights into data analysis and prediction in the context of the marine environment.
